# Web-Scrapping
Scrapes restaurant data and converts into csv file and creates a folder where images are downloaded.
Libraries to be Installed :
> bs4 (BeautifulSoup)
> re (Regular Expressions)
> selenium
> webdriver_manager

If the webdriver from selenium doesnt work, sometimes due to configuration of few operating systems , need to install the library 
> chromedriver and import the absolute path in wevdriver.chrome(your path) function


If the webdriver works , then no need to install chromedriver , and only the function webdriver.chrome() can be used.
